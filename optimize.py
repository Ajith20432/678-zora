"""
optimize.py — walk-forward parameter search (`python bot.py optimize`).

Freqtrade-style hyperopt without the optuna dependency (which is heavy on a phone): seeded
random search over EXIT parameters only, scored on a TRAIN window, then the best candidates
are re-tested on a held-out TEST window the search never saw. Out-of-sample results are what
count; if they collapse the report says OVERFIT instead of recommending anything.

Safety rules, on purpose:
  * risk-per-trade, exposure, drawdown and daily-loss limits are NEVER searched — an optimizer
    that is rewarded for profit will happily raise them.
  * nothing is written to .env. The report only SUGGESTS values; a human applies them.
  * signals are computed once and reused (they don't depend on the exit parameters), so
    hundreds of trials cost seconds, not hours.
