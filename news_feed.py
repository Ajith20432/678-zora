"""
news_feed.py — pulls recent crypto headlines from public RSS feeds (no API
key, no rate-limit quota to run out of, format unlikely to break overnight —
good properties for something running unattended on a phone) and scores a
simple keyword-based sentiment.

This becomes a "news" expert, exactly like the technical timeframes and the
AI panel — the auto-learning brain decides over time how much to trust it.
The matched headlines are also handed to multi_ai.py so the LLM panel (if
configured) gets real context instead of guessing blind.

This is a blunt keyword heuristic, not real NLP sentiment analysis — it
will misread sarcasm, headlines that mention a bad thing NOT happening, etc.
Treat it as one noisy vote among several, which is exactly how the brain
ends up treating it once it has a few dozen trades to learn from.
